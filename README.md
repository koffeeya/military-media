# Why The Military Makes Movies

### The Pentagon has a propaganda machine: the military-entertainment complex.

For over 100 years, the Pentagon has allowed producers of entertainment to use military resources in exchange for control and censorship over content. The DoD’s website lists two reasons why: “to accurately depict military stories and make sure sensitive information isn’t disclosed.” 

But there are clearly other reasons. For example, after Top Gun released in 1986 -- a movie that closely involved the Pentagon from the start -- the U.S. Navy saw a 500% spike in the number of young men wanting to be Naval Aviators. The DoD’s own private data notes that Top Gun “completed [the] rehabilitation of the military’s image, which had been savaged by the Vietnam War.”

### I want to explore the impact of the military’s involvement in the media. How does it affect its image, recruitment efforts, and the kind of stories that get told?
