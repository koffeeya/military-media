**HOW HOLLYWOOD AND THE MILITARY WORK TOGETHER**

The U.S. military and Hollywood have been actively working together since the dawn of American cinema. This project explores their collaboration through a database of 500+ film productions that requested military assistance in the last century. How does the relationship between the military and Hollywood work? What kinds of movies get military support? And what can we learn from films that do — or don’t — make the cut?
